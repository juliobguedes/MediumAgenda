# Medium Agenda

Medium Agenda is a website that you, as wonderful story reader, can track progress of notes, claps and comments in the medium stories that you read.

In the daily use of Medium Agenda, you'll have a to-do list of stories fed by your Medium Daily Digest and a list of the stories you read in the past.
